    "# Glitching an Image\n",
    "\n",
    "Glitching can be achieved in many different ways, including by opening an image file in a text editor and making random changes to the data, or by opening an image file in something like [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) and running sound filters on the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code below is by Mathieu Guimond-Morganti, and can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/guimondmm/prism-sort-glitch). His script allows you to take an input picture file (jpg) and specify parameters by which the data in that file will be manipulated. It works by isolating rows and columns of the data and doing a broken sort of the data (see also [this](http://datamoshing.com/2016/06/16/how-to-glitch-images-using-pixel-sorting/)). \n",
